# Liv-Zempel-using-cpp-


compin.txt file will be compressed into compin.fz file and then compin.fz file will be decompressed into compin.new.txt file.

I did not pay attention to file extensions and other security stuff. Program can(or should) compress any txt file and should
decompress any file which was compressed using Liv-Zempel algorithm with 4096 keys(no key generating after table gets full).
